# Product Context: Grandus Game

## Purpose
Grandus is designed to provide a visually engaging and progressively complex gameplay experience, where players witness their actions evolve from manual tasks to managing vast automated systems. The game aims to capture the satisfaction of scale and incremental growth, inspired by games like Dyson Sphere Program and Factorio, but with a unique blend of progression mechanics and cooperative potential.

## Problems it Solves
- **Engagement through Progression:** Addresses the need for games that offer a clear sense of progression and scale, moving beyond simple numeric increases to visually impactful growth.
- **Gradual Complexity Introduction:** Solves the problem of player overwhelm by introducing new mechanics and UI elements incrementally, ensuring a smooth learning curve and sustained engagement.
- **Meaningful Offline and Cooperative Play:** Provides satisfying offline progression and lays the foundation for future cooperative gameplay, enhancing long-term player investment and community building.

## How it Should Work
- **Visual and Automated Scale:** Start with manual resource gathering, gradually transitioning to automated systems and larger management scopes (town -> multiverse).
- **Progressive Complexity:** Introduce game mechanics in stages, starting with basic resource collection and expanding to combat, crafting, and advanced upgrades.
- **Incremental Progression:** Offer clear, incremental growth through both active and passive gameplay phases, with offline progression complementing active engagement.
- **Cooperative Gameplay (Future):** Implement guild mechanics for resource sharing, cooperative research, and mutual progression benefits.

## User Experience Goals
- **Visually Rewarding Progression:** Players should visually perceive their growth and the increasing scale of their operations.
- **Satisfying Automation:** The transition from manual to automated systems should be a rewarding and visually satisfying experience.
- **Engaging Complexity Curve:** Complexity should be introduced gradually, maintaining player engagement without overwhelming them at any stage.
- **Meaningful Choices:** Players should feel that their choices in resource management, upgrades, and combat strategy have a significant impact on their progression.
- **Community and Cooperation (Future):** Foster a sense of community and cooperation through guild mechanics and shared progression goals.
