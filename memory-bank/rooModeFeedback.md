## story-groomer Feedback

*   Mode needs to improve its ability to translate story goals into comprehensive acceptance criteria, especially regarding visual state and entity management (2)
    *   User provided a screenshot of the current UI.
    *   User clarified that the Stone node should not be strictly centered in the hex.
    *   User specified that the placement should allow visual space for the player character to move between the Home Base and the Stone node within the same hex.
    *   User requested an explicit AC to ensure only the Home Base and initial Stone node are displayed initially, and specifically mentioned the removal of other nodes.
*   Grooming identified implementation ambiguities best resolved during technical planning (1)
    *   Specific feedback: User clarified that specific implementation decisions (e.g., mandatory ResourceService, ResourceSystem fate, adapter scope) for this technical refactoring story should be deferred to the architect-planner phase, as they require deeper code analysis.
*   Groomer's proposed Acceptance Criteria were clear and required no user modification (1)
    *   Specific Example: User confirmed proposed refined Acceptance Criteria were accurate and ready without further changes for story-04a.

## architect-planner Feedback

*   User questioned potential premature architecture but accepted the Store+Service approach after justification based on project standards and future needs (1)
    *   Specific feedback: User provided detailed feedback on implementation options, questioning potential premature architecture but ultimately okay with proceeding with Option 2 (Store+Service) after re-evaluation.
*   Technical plans require revision to ensure proper vertical slicing and cleanup of related code elements (4)
    *   Specific Example: Plan revised twice based on user feedback regarding vertical slicing for regression prevention and the need to clean up dead event wiring (onResourceGathered) in story-03b.
    *   Specific Example: Plan revised based on user feedback for Story 04a (naming, grouping, units).
    *   Specific Example: User provided feedback rejecting the initial plan due to tasks mixing concepts and causing broken intermediate states. The plan was revised to break tasks down by single data concepts (respawn, yield, capacity, etc.) ensuring each task updates all affected files and results in a compilable/runnable state. Repomix context was provided and reviewed, confirming the revised plan structure (Story 04a1).
*   Entity type definitions combine graphical and state concerns, leading to potential code smells and future refactoring needs (2)
    *   Specific Example: User raised concerns about the dual purpose of Entity types (graphical vs. runtime state) and initialEntityData, identifying it as a "code smell." Acknowledged the pragmatic need for the current approach for initialization but agreed that future refactoring to bifurcate type definitions is warranted. Approved the core logic of Tasks 2 (Store Creation/Init) and 3 (Service Integration) within the plan.
    *   Specific Example: Plan significantly revised for Story 04a based on detailed user analysis of code smells (mixed entity properties) and proposed refactoring approach (bifurcation).

## code-executor Feedback

*   Implemented code introduces architectural issues that require further refinement (1)
    *   i missed some architectual issues when looking at the output of the code executor, can you spin up a new architecture task so that i can refine the ideas implemented
*   Code Executor lacks the necessary tools or permissions to perform file deletion tasks (1)
    *   Specific Example: User manually completed Task 7 (file deletion) in story-03-tech-story-refactor-implement-resource-node-state-management.md as the mode lacked permission/tool for it.
*   Code requires correction based on user feedback regarding implementation details (e.g., logic correctness, adherence to original behavior, variable naming, data source usage, missing related file modifications) (3)
    *   Specific Example: Corrected player return position in GatheringService to match original home base return logic (Story 03b, Task 2).
    *   Specific Example: Corrected player ID usage ('player' vs 'player1') and node finding data source (scene entities via new method vs. global state) in adapter (Story 03b, Task 3).
    *   Specific Example: User correctly identified that initialEntityConverter.ts also needed updating for Task 0 (Story 04).
