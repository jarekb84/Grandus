## story-groomer Feedback

*   Mode needs to improve its ability to translate story goals into comprehensive acceptance criteria, especially regarding visual state and entity management (1)
    *   User provided a screenshot of the current UI.
    *   User clarified that the Stone node should not be strictly centered in the hex.
    *   User specified that the placement should allow visual space for the player character to move between the Home Base and the Stone node within the same hex.
    *   User requested an explicit AC to ensure only the Home Base and initial Stone node are displayed initially, and specifically mentioned the removal of other nodes.
*   Grooming identified implementation ambiguities best resolved during technical planning (1)
    *   Specific feedback: User clarified that specific implementation decisions (e.g., mandatory ResourceService, ResourceSystem fate, adapter scope) for this technical refactoring story should be deferred to the architect-planner phase, as they require deeper code analysis.

## architect-planner Feedback

*   User questioned potential premature architecture but accepted the Store+Service approach after justification based on project standards and future needs (1)
    *   Specific feedback: User provided detailed feedback on implementation options, questioning potential premature architecture but ultimately okay with proceeding with Option 2 (Store+Service) after re-evaluation.
*   Technical plans require revision to ensure proper vertical slicing and cleanup of related code elements (1)
    *   Specific Example: Plan revised twice based on user feedback regarding vertical slicing for regression prevention and the need to clean up dead event wiring (onResourceGathered) in story-03b.

## code-executor Feedback

*   Implemented code introduces architectural issues that require further refinement (1)
    *   i missed some architectual issues when looking at the output of the code executor, can you spin up a new architecture task so that i can refine the ideas implemented
*   Code Executor lacks the necessary tools or permissions to perform file deletion tasks (1)
    *   Specific Example: User manually completed Task 7 (file deletion) in story-03-tech-story-refactor-implement-resource-node-state-management.md as the mode lacked permission/tool for it.
*   Code requires correction based on user feedback regarding implementation details (e.g., logic correctness, adherence to original behavior, variable naming, data source usage) (2)
    *   Specific Example: Corrected player return position in GatheringService to match original home base return logic (Story 03b, Task 2).
    *   Specific Example: Corrected player ID usage ('player' vs 'player1') and node finding data source (scene entities via new method vs. global state) in adapter (Story 03b, Task 3).
