# Project Brief: Grandus Game

## Core Idea
Develop a game centered around visual scale, automation, and progressive complexity, starting from manual resource gathering to managing vast automated systems across multiple stages of progression.

## High-Level Goals
- Implement core gameplay loop: Resource Gathering -> Management -> Combat/Expansion.
- Visually represent scale and progression.
- Gradually introduce complexity in mechanics and UI.
- Design for incremental and offline progression.
- Lay groundwork for future cooperative gameplay.

## Initial Focus
Prototype the core gameplay loop with basic resource collection, combat mechanics, and essential upgrade systems using React/Next.js and PhaserJs.
