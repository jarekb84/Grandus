# Project Brief: Grandus Game

## Core Idea
Develop a game centered around visual scale, automation, and progressive complexity, starting from manual resource gathering to managing vast automated systems across multiple stages of progression.

## High-Level Goals
- Implement core gameplay loop centered around three distinct views: **Territory View** (Plan & Gather), **Management View** (Prepare & Upgrade), and **Combat Scene** (Execute & Progress).
- Visually represent scale and automation, from manual gathering to complex systems.
- Gradually introduce complexity in mechanics (hex-based territory, crafting, Workshop/Labs) and UI across the different views.
- Design for incremental progression balancing active gameplay (Territory/Combat) and offline simulation (Gathering).
- Lay groundwork for future cooperative gameplay.

## Initial Focus
Prototype the core Territory -> Management -> Combat loop with basic visual gathering (Territory View), initial Workshop/Crafting (Management View), and basic combat mechanics (Combat Scene) using React/Next.js and PhaserJs.
