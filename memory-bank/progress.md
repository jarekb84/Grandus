# Progress: Grandus Game

## What Works
- **Basic Project Setup:** Next.js project with TypeScript, configured with ESLint.
- **Core Game Structure:** Initial structure for features, including `combat`, `gathering`, `management`, and `core` game components.
- **Combat Feature Prototype:** Basic combat scene in PhaserJs with geometric enemies and player projectile system.
- **State Management:** Zustand setup for game-wide state management.
- **Game Engine Integration:** PhaserJs integrated into React components for rendering game scenes.

## What's Left to Build
- **Gathering Mode Mechanics:** Implement resource gathering gameplay, visual representation, and progression.
- **Management Mode UI:** Develop React-based UI for workshop, labs, crafting, and resource management.
- **Upgrade Systems:** Implement workshop and lab upgrade mechanics to drive player progression.
- **Resource System:** Flesh out resource types, storage, and utilization across game modes.
- **Crafting System:** Design and implement crafting mechanics for items and equipment.
- **Stage Progression:** Implement stage-based progression from Wilderness to higher stages, with scaling challenges and rewards.
- **UI/UX Improvements:** Enhance overall user interface and user experience across all game modes.
- **Sound and Visual Effects:** Add sound effects and visual enhancements to improve game feel.
- **Testing and Balancing:** Thoroughly test and balance gameplay mechanics, progression, and economy.
- **Future Features:** Cooperative gameplay, guild mechanics, and expanded game scope.

## Current Status
- **Prototyping Phase:** Core mechanics and game structure are being prototyped and iterated.
- **Documentation:** Memory bank documentation is being established to capture project vision, architecture, and progress.
- **Development Team:** Currently single developer.

## Known Issues
- **Performance Optimization:** Combat scene performance needs optimization for larger enemy waves.
- **UI/UX Polish:** Current UI is basic and needs significant improvement for user-friendliness.
- **Content Scope:** Initial content is limited; needs expansion in resources, upgrades, and game stages.
