# Progress: Grandus Game

## What Works
- **Basic Project Setup:** Next.js project with TypeScript, configured with ESLint.
- **Core Game Structure:** Initial structure for features, including `combat`, `territory`, `management`, and `core` game components.
- **Combat Feature Prototype:** Basic combat scene in PhaserJs with geometric enemies and player projectile system.
- **State Management:** Zustand setup for game-wide state management.
- **Game Engine Integration:** PhaserJs integrated into React components for rendering game scenes.

## What's Left to Build (Based on Refined GAMEPLAN.MD & MVP)

**Core Loop Implementation (MVP Focus):**
-   **Territory View (PhaserJS):**
    -   Implement basic hex grid overlay.
    -   **[DONE]** Implement visual gathering: 1 gatherer entity (blue circle), 1 resource type (Stone, grey squares), movement to nearest node, return to base (triggered by 'G' key).
    -   Implement basic hex interaction: Click hexes (Home + 1 adjacent), display simple info panel, `Expand Combat` button.
    -   Basic resource inventory tracking (Stone).
-   **Combat Scene (PhaserJS):**
    -   Trigger scene via `Expand Combat`.
    -   Implement player entity firing basic projectiles (consuming Pebbles).
    -   Spawn 1-2 basic enemy types.
    -   Implement basic Depth/Distance counter.
    -   End run on player defeat.
    -   Implement basic run completion logic (award Coins).
-   **Management View (React):**
    -   Create basic view structure with Workshop tab.
    -   Implement Coin currency display.
    -   Implement 1 basic Workshop upgrade (e.g., +Pebble Damage) purchasable with Coins.
    -   Implement basic Crafting: Stone -> Pebbles recipe.
-   **Core Loop Connection:**
    -   Link Combat completion (`Expand`) to changing hex status to "Controlled" in Territory View.
    -   Update Combat to use crafted Pebbles as ammo.

**Broader Mechanics (Post-MVP):**
-   **Territory View Enhancements:** Multiple gatherers, different node types, node depletion/replenishment visuals & logic, `Enhance Hex` action, Fog of War/Scouting.
-   **Management View Enhancements:** Implement Labs (timed research), more complex crafting recipes, full Workshop/Labs upgrade trees, Goal Tracking UI.
-   **Combat Scene Enhancements:** Implement `Enhance Hex` logic (scaling difficulty, depth saving), Clearing Speed mechanic, dual currency ($/Coins) drops and in-run upgrades, diverse enemy types/bosses, ammo types, potential player abilities.
-   **Resource System:** Full implementation of multiple resource types, storage limits, cross-stage relevance, resource transformation.
-   **Stage Progression:** Implement mechanics for progressing through stages (Wilderness -> Town -> etc.), including stage-specific resources/challenges and cross-stage upgrades.
-   **State Architecture:** Implement domain-specific stores, event bus, adapters, DI, services as outlined in `STATE_ARCHITECTURE.MD`.
-   **Performance Optimizations:** Implement Milestone 2+ optimizations (Object Pooling, Spatial Partitioning) as needed based on `PERFORMANCE_PLAN.MD` thresholds.
-   **UI/UX Improvements:** Refine UI across all views based on Progressive Disclosure principle. Improve visual feedback and game feel.
-   **Sound and Visual Effects:** Add audio and enhance visual effects.
-   **Testing and Balancing:** Comprehensive testing and balancing of all systems.
-   **Future Features:** Cooperative gameplay, guilds, trading.

## Current Status
- **Planning & Foundation Phase:** Core game plan significantly refined (`docs/GAMEPLAN.MD`). Memory Bank updated to reflect the detailed vision. Foundational project structure exists. Basic combat prototype exists. Initial structural refactoring is complete.
- **Architecture Defined:** Performance optimization strategy (`PERFORMANCE_PLAN.MD`) and state management architecture (`STATE_ARCHITECTURE.MD`) are documented.
- **Development Team:** Currently single developer.
- **Next Steps:** Focus shifted to implementing the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) features. Visual gathering MVP is complete. Next is basic hex interaction in the Territory View.

## Known Issues
- **Performance Bottlenecks (Identified):** Initial tests show performance degradation above ~4,000 entities, primarily linked to projectile creation/collision checks. Optimization plan exists (`PERFORMANCE_PLAN.MD`). Milestone 1 optimizations (state separation, update frequency) are conceptually in place or easy to add.
- **UI/UX Polish:** Current UI is placeholder/basic and needs significant work following the Progressive Disclosure principle.
- **Content Scope:** MVP content is minimal; requires expansion post-MVP.

[2025-04-12 14:22] - Task Completed: Consolidated project rules from legacy `.clinerules`/`.cursorrules` into the standard Roo format (`.roo/rules/` and `.roo/rules-code/`).

[2025-04-12 14:49] - Defined workflow strategy (memory-bank/workflowStrategy.md) and persisted Epics/Stories breakdown into docs/epics/ and docs/stories/ structure.

[2025-04-12 15:14] - Task Completed: Story docs/stories/epic1/01_Foundation_Hex_Grid_Integration_Home_Base.md - Home Base positioned in center hex, gatherer starts relative.
