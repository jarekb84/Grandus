# Active Context: Grandus Game

## Current Work Focus
Establishing the foundational memory bank and project documentation. Defining the high-level game plan and vision.

## Recent Changes
- Created `projectbrief.md` to outline project goals and scope.
- Drafted `productContext.md` to detail the game's purpose, problem-solving aspects, mechanics, and user experience goals.

## Next Steps
- Define system patterns and architecture in `systemPatterns.md`.
- Detail the technologies, setup, and constraints in `techContext.md`.
- Outline current progress, status, and known issues in `progress.md`.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Structuring the memory bank for clear, hierarchical documentation.
- Ensuring each document builds upon the project brief and contributes to a comprehensive understanding of the game.
- Balancing detail and conciseness in initial documentation to provide a solid foundation without premature deep dives.
