# Active Context: Grandus Game

## Current Work Focus
Executing the incremental refactoring plan to align the prototype with the `GAMEPLAN.MD` vision. The detailed steps are tracked in `memory-bank/plans/REFACTORING_PLAN.MD`.

## Recent Changes
- Reviewed all existing Memory Bank files and `/docs` directory contents.
- Updated all core Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`) to reflect the refined game plan and architecture.
- Created the initial `.clinerules` file.
- Created `memory-bank/plans/REFACTORING_PLAN.MD` detailing the incremental refactoring steps.

## Next Steps
1.  Update `.clinerules` with the agreed-upon note regarding `repomix-output.xml` usage for context updates.
2.  Begin executing Step 1 of the refactoring plan: "Rename Gathering -> Territory".

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Established a detailed, incremental refactoring plan stored in `memory-bank/plans/REFACTORING_PLAN.MD`.
- Agreed on using `memory-bank/plans/` for storing detailed task-specific plans.
- Agreed to add a note to `.clinerules` about preferred context update methods (using `repomix-output.xml`).
