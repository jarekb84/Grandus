# Active Context: Grandus Game

## Current Work Focus
Updating the Memory Bank based on revised `/docs` documentation (`GAMEPLAN.MD`, `PERFORMANCE_PLAN.MD`, `STATE_ARCHITECTURE.MD`) and establishing the initial `.clinerules` file.

## Recent Changes
- Reviewed all existing Memory Bank files.
- Reviewed all files in the `/docs` directory.
- Updated `projectbrief.md` to align high-level goals with the refined core loop.
- Updated `productContext.md` to incorporate detailed mechanics (Territory/Management/Combat views, etc.).
- Overhauled `systemPatterns.md` to reflect the detailed architecture, design patterns, and technical decisions from `/docs`.
- Updated `techContext.md` with notes on performance strategy and state architecture patterns.
- Updated `progress.md` with refined MVP scope, detailed "What's Left to Build", current status, and known issues based on `/docs`.

## Next Steps
1.  Create the initial `.clinerules` file, capturing foundational project patterns derived from the documentation.
2.  Signal completion of the Memory Bank update task.
3.  Proceed with implementing the refined MVP features as outlined in `progress.md`, likely starting with Territory View basics.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Synthesizing detailed information from multiple `/docs` files into concise, actionable Memory Bank entries.
- Ensuring consistency across all Memory Bank files.
- Identifying key, foundational patterns from the documentation to seed the `.clinerules` file.
