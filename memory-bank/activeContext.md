# Active Context: Grandus Game

## Current Work Focus
The planned structural refactoring is complete. Focus is now on implementing the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) features as outlined in `memory-bank/progress.md`.

## Recent Changes
- Reviewed all existing Memory Bank files and `/docs` directory contents.
- Updated all core Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`) to reflect the refined game plan and architecture.
- Created the initial `.clinerules` file.
- Created `memory-bank/plans/REFACTORING_PLAN.MD` detailing the incremental refactoring steps.
- [2025-04-12 00:07] Completed Step 1 of refactoring: Renamed `src/features/gathering/` directory to `src/features/territory/`.
- [2025-04-12 00:10] Completed planned structural refactoring and deleted the associated plan file (`memory-bank/plans/REFACTORING_PLAN.MD`).
- [2025-04-12 00:12] Identified that the Territory View MVP step "Implement basic hex grid overlay" (from `progress.md`) is already implemented in `src/features/territory/Territory.scene.ts`.
- [2025-04-12 12:14] Implemented Territory View MVP feature: Basic visual gathering (gatherer moves to nearest Stone node and returns to base on 'G' key press) in `src/features/territory/Territory.scene.ts`.
- [2025-04-12 14:22] Migrated project rules from `.clinerules` and `.cursorrules` to the new Roo format (`.roo/rules/` and `.roo/rules-code/`).

## Next Steps
1. Implement Territory View MVP feature: Basic hex interaction (Click hexes (Home + 1 adjacent), display simple info panel, `Expand Combat` button) (as per `memory-bank/progress.md`).
## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Agreed to add a note to `.clinerules` about preferred context update methods (using `repomix-output.xml`).
