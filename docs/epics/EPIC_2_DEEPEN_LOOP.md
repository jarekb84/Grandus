# Epic 2: Deepening the Loop & Introducing Choice

*   **Goal:** Build upon the established loop by introducing a second resource type, meaningful ways to spend combat rewards ($), and the concept of improving already controlled territory (`Enhance Hex`).
*   **Focus:** Adding complexity within the existing loop, giving the player more strategic choices (Expand vs. Enhance, how to spend $), and starting to differentiate hexes.
