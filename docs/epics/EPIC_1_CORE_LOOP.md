# Epic 1: Establish the Core Gameplay Loop (Gather-Prepare-Expand)

*   **Goal:** Implement the fundamental cycle: Gather initial resources -> Use them in a targeted expansion attempt -> Earn currency -> Use currency to unlock preparation (crafting) -> Use crafted items to succeed in expansion -> Gain access to better gathering.
*   **Focus:** Connecting the three views through a necessary and rewarding progression path. Make the first expansion meaningful.
