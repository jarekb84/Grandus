# Story: Foundation: Hex Grid Integration & Home Base

Refactor entity positioning to be hex-based. Place the player's Home Base visually within the central hex.

## Acceptance Criteria

*   Home base circle is clearly centered/contained within the middle hex tile.
*   Player entity's origin/movement is relative to hexes.

## Notes

*   This corrects the current visual misalignment and sets the stage for spatial resource management.
