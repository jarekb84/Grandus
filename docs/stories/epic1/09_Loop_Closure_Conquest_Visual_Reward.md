# Story: Loop Closure: Conquest Visual & Reward

When a hex is successfully "Conquered" (Wave 10 cleared), update its state in the Territory View (e.g., change color, show "Controlled" in info panel). Place a *new*, slightly better Stone node within the conquered hex (e.g., holds 5-10 Stone, maybe slightly faster respawn).

## Acceptance Criteria

*   Conquering a hex visually updates the Territory map.
*   The info panel reflects the "Controlled" status.
*   A new gatherable Stone node appears in the conquered hex.
*   Gathering logic can now target nodes in this hex.
