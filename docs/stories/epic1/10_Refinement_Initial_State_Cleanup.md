# Story: Refinement: Initial State & Cleanup

Ensure the player starts with 0 resources (or just enough base health/a default weak attack if needed before pebbles). Remove the existing generic "Expand Combat" button. Remove unused Gather Wood/Food buttons for now.

## Acceptance Criteria

*   Game starts cleanly in the intended initial state for Epic 1.
*   Old buttons/infinite nodes are gone.
