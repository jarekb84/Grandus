# Story: Management: Gated Crafting

Modify the "Craft 10 Pebbles" button. It should only be visible/enabled *after* the "Unlock Pebble Crafting" research is completed. Crafting still costs 1 Stone and produces 10 Pebbles.

## Acceptance Criteria

*   Crafting button is initially hidden/disabled.
*   It appears/enables after spending Coins on the research.
*   Crafting functions as before once unlocked, consuming Stone and disabling if insufficient Stone.
