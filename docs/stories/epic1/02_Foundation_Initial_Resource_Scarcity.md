# Story: Foundation: Initial Resource Scarcity

Remove randomly sprinkled infinite nodes. Place a *single* Stone node within the Home Base hex. This node should contain a small, finite amount of Stone (e.g., 1-3 units).

## Acceptance Criteria

*   Only one Stone node exists initially, located in the home hex.
*   `Gather Stone` targets this node.
*   Node has a defined capacity.
