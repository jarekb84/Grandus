# Story: Management: Gated Access & Basic Research

Lock the Management View tab/button initially. Unlock it *only* after the player earns their first Coin. Implement a rudimentary "Research" concept within Management: a button/action to "Unlock Pebble Crafting" that costs 1 or 2 Coins.

## Acceptance Criteria

*   Management view is inaccessible at game start.
*   It becomes accessible after earning the first Coin.
*   Inside Management, there's an action ("Research Pebble Crafting") requiring Coins.
