# Story: Loop Closure: `Enhance Hex` Rewards

Successfully completing an `Enhance Hex` run (i.e., setting a *new* Max Wave Cleared for that hex) should permanently improve that hex's properties displayed in the Territory view (e.g., slightly increase node capacity, decrease node respawn timer).

## Acceptance Criteria

*   Setting a new record depth in `Enhance Hex` updates the hex's stats (visible in info panel).
*   These bonuses affect the actual node behavior (e.g., faster respawns).
