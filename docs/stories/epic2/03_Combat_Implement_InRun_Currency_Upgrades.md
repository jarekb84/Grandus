# Story: Combat: Implement In-Run Currency ($) & Upgrades

Activate the `$` currency. Enemies now drop `$` upon death. Add a simple in-run "Upgrades" panel/button accessible during Combat. Offer 1-2 temporary upgrades purchasable with `$` (e.g., "+Temporary Damage", "+Temporary Attack Speed"). `$` resets to 0 at the end of each run.

## Acceptance Criteria

*   Enemies drop `$`.
*   `$` accumulates during a run.
*   An in-run UI allows spending `$` on temporary stat boosts.
*   `$` is lost upon run completion (win or loss).
