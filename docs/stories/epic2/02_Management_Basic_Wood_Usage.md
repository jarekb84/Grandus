# Story: Management: Basic Wood Usage (Crafting/Research)

Introduce a simple use for Wood. Could be a basic Research unlock (e.g., "Improved Stone Gathering Tools" costing Wood+Coins) or a simple Crafting recipe (e.g., "Simple Torch" - maybe a future combat item, or just placeholder).

## Acceptance Criteria

*   Wood can be consumed via a new Research or Crafting option in the Management view.
