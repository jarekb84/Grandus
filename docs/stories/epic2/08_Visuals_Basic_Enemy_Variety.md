# Story: Visuals: Basic Enemy Variety

Introduce a second enemy type (e.g., the "Line" enemy from the plan). Make it appear in later waves or during `Enhance Hex` runs. Give it slightly different stats (e.g., more HP or faster speed).

## Acceptance Criteria

*   A second visually distinct enemy type appears in combat under defined conditions.
*   It behaves differently according to its stats.
