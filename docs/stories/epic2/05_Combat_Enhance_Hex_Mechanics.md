# Story: Combat: `Enhance Hex` Mechanics

Define `Enhance Hex` combat runs: They likely start at a higher difficulty baseline or scale faster than `Expand Combat`. The goal is to push the "Max Wave Cleared" as high as possible. Maybe introduce slightly tougher/faster enemy variants.

## Acceptance Criteria

*   Initiating `Enhance Hex` starts a combat run with potentially different scaling.
*   The run tracks waves cleared.
