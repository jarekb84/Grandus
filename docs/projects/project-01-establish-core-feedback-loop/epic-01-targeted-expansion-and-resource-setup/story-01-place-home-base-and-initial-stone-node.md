# User Story: Place Home Base and Initial Stone Node

**Epic:** [`epic-01-targeted-expansion-and-resource-setup.md`](epic-01-targeted-expansion-and-resource-setup.md)
**Epic Goal:** Align home base and initial Stone node within specific hexes in Territory View. Implement hex selection to target the `Expand Combat` action specifically at an adjacent hex. Set up the initial home Stone node to be depletable/limited (e.g., 1 Stone capacity, slow respawn) as per the loop requirements. *(Refines existing Territory view for targeted actions and correct initial state).*

## Story Goal

Epic Goal Summary: Align home base and initial Stone node within specific hexes in Territory View. Implement hex selection to target the `Expand Combat` action specifically at an adjacent hex.

Project Context (if available in Epic):
  Project Title: project-01-establish-core-feedback-loop
  Project Goal: Implement the minimum viable gameplay loop connecting the core views: Gather Stone in Territory View, initiate Expand Combat, earn persistent Coins from Combat success (e.g., clearing Wave 1), spend Coins in a minimal Management View to unlock basic Stone-to-Pebble crafting, use crafted Pebbles to conquer the first Hex (e.g., clear Wave 10), and have the conquered Hex reveal a better/new Stone node.
