# Epic: 01-Targeted-Expansion-And-Resource-Setup

## Epic Goal

*   Align home base and initial Stone node within specific hexes in Territory View. Implement hex selection to target the `Expand Combat` action specifically at an adjacent hex. Set up the initial home Stone node to be depletable/limited (e.g., 1 Stone capacity, slow respawn) as per the loop requirements. *(Refines existing Territory view for targeted actions and correct initial state).*

## Status

*   Proposed

## Linked Project

*   **Project File:** [`project-01-establish-core-feedback-loop.md`](../project-01-establish-core-feedback-loop.md)
*   **Overall Project Goal:** Implement the minimum viable gameplay loop connecting the core views: Gather Stone in Territory View, initiate Expand Combat, earn persistent Coins from Combat success (e.g., clearing Wave 1), spend Coins in a minimal Management View to unlock basic Stone-to-Pebble crafting, use crafted Pebbles to conquer the first Hex (e.g., clear Wave 10), and have the conquered Hex reveal a better/new Stone node.

## Scope & Key Features (for this Epic)

*   Refactor Territory View (PhaserJS) to place the Home Base entity visually centered within a designated home hex.
*   Place the initial Stone resource node visually centered within the home hex.
*   Implement logic for the initial Stone node to have a limited capacity (e.g., 1 Stone) and a slow respawn/replenish rate.
*   Implement hex selection interaction: Clicking an adjacent, uncontrolled hex highlights it and sets it as the target for the `Expand Combat` action.
*   Modify the `Expand Combat` button logic to only initiate combat against the currently selected target hex.
*   Ensure visual feedback for hex selection (e.g., highlight, outline).

## Out of Scope (for this Epic)

*   Implementing the actual Combat Scene.
*   Awarding any currency (`Coins` or `$`).
*   Handling conquest logic or revealing nodes on conquered hexes.
*   Placing nodes outside the home hex initially.
*   Gathering from nodes outside the home hex.

## Embedded Project Context

*   **Relevant Project Sections:**
    *   From Project Goal: Gather Stone in Territory View, initiate Expand Combat... conquer the first Hex... reveal a better/new Stone node.
    *   From Key Systems: Territory View (PhaserJS): Basic visual gathering (Stone), Hex selection/interaction, `Expand Combat` initiation.
    *   From Source Context (MVP Refined): `Territory View` Basics (PhaserJS): Scene with Home Base, one resource type (Stone nodes)... Basic Hex Interaction (Territory View): Allow clicking on the Home Base hex and one adjacent hex... Add `Expand Combat` button...
    *   From User Context: ...move the player base into the middle of one of these hexes and add a stone patch that depletes... select a node that I haven't really discovered before. And then I can maybe attack it... the initial stone patch near me in my home base maybe only has one stone. And it replenishes every second.

## Notes / Design Links / Dependencies (Optional)

*   Requires existing PhaserJS Territory scene setup with hex grid.
*   Requires existing basic gathering logic (to be adapted for limited node).
*   Requires existing `Expand Combat` button (logic to be modified).
