# User Story: Place Home Base Visually in Home Hex

**Epic:** [`epic-01-targeted-expansion-and-resource-setup.md`](./epic-01-targeted-expansion-and-resource-setup.md)
**Epic Goal:** Align home base and initial Stone node within specific hexes in Territory View. Implement hex selection to target the `Expand Combat` action specifically at an adjacent hex. Set up the initial home Stone node to be depletable/limited (e.g., 1 Stone capacity, slow respawn) as per the loop requirements. *(Refines existing Territory view for targeted actions and correct initial state).*

Epic Goal Summary: Align home base and initial Stone node within specific hexes in Territory View. Implement hex selection to target the Expand Combat action specifically at an adjacent hex. Set up the initial home Stone node to be depletable/limited (e.g., 1 Stone capacity, slow respawn) as per the loop requirements.

Project Context (if available in Epic):
  Project Title: project-01-establish-core-feedback-loop
  Project Goal: Implement the minimum viable gameplay loop connecting the core views: Gather Stone in Territory View, initiate Expand Combat, earn persistent Coins from Combat success (e.g., clearing Wave 1), spend Coins in a minimal Management View to unlock basic Stone-to-Pebble crafting, use crafted Pebbles to conquer the first Hex (e.g., clear Wave 1), and have the conquered Hex reveal a better/new Stone node.
