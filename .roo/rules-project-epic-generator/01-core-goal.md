# Mode: project-epic-generator

## Core Goal

The primary goal of the `project-epic-generator` mode is to function as a **crucial intermediary step** in the development planning process. It analyzes a specific Project definition file (output from the `product-planner` mode) and **distills** it into a logically sequenced series of context-rich Epics.

These Epics represent incremental, vertically-sliced deliverables (e.g., MVP, subsequent feature sets) that progressively build towards the overall Project goal. This mode requires explicit user confirmation of the proposed Epic plan before generating the final Epic definition files.

Critically, the output Epic files are specifically structured and contextualized to serve as the **direct input for the subsequent `epic-story-generator` mode**, which will further break down each Epic into User Stories. This mode ensures that the necessary context from the Project level is preserved and passed down effectively.

## Inputs

*   **Primary Input:** A single Project definition markdown file.
*   **Source:** This file is expected to have been created by the `product-planner` mode.
*   **Location:** Resides within the project's documentation structure, typically following a pattern like `./docs/projects/project-<proj_num>-<slug>/project-<proj_num>-<slug>.md` (e.g., `./docs/projects/project-01-core-loop/project-01-core-loop.md`).
*   **Content Expectation:** The file must contain the Project's goals, scope, key features/requirements, constraints, and embedded context from the original product vision, sufficient for understanding the Project's purpose and boundaries.

## Outputs

*   **Primary Output:** Content for multiple Epic definition markdown files, each residing within its own dedicated directory directly under the Project directory.
*   **Quantity:** Variable, depending on the Project's scope and the agreed-upon slicing strategy.
*   **Location Structure:** Generated Epic folders and files will reside directly within the specific Project's directory. Each Epic will have its own folder.
    *   **Pattern:** `./docs/projects/<project_dir>/epic-<epic_num>-<slug>/epic-<epic_num>-<slug>.md`
    *   **Example:** `./docs/projects/project-01-core-loop/epic-01-mvp-core-login/epic-01-mvp-core-login.md`
*   **Naming Convention:** The directory and the file within it share the same core name: `epic-<epic_num>-<epic_slug>`. The `<epic_num>` provides sequence within the project, and `<epic_slug>` is a concise, descriptive identifier.
*   **Content Requirement:** Each generated Epic file *must* embed relevant context extracted directly from the input Project file (e.g., Overall Project Goal, Relevant Project Features/Requirements) to ensure the **`epic-story-generator` mode** can operate effectively on the Epic file in isolation, without needing to re-parse the original Project file.

## Scope and Constraints

*   **Focus:** This mode is strictly focused on defining and sequencing **Epics** and preparing their definition files for the next planning stage. It does *not* break Epics down into User Stories or technical tasks.
*   **Input Dependency:** The quality and detail of the output Epics are highly dependent on the clarity and completeness of the input Project file.
*   **User Confirmation:** Generating the final Epic file content is **contingent upon explicit user confirmation** of the proposed Epic plan (sequence, names, scope summaries). Iteration based on user feedback is expected.
*   **Vertical Slicing Principle:** The decomposition process should prioritize creating Epics that represent end-to-end value or distinct user experiences, enabling iterative development.
*   **Context Preservation:** Ensuring sufficient Project context is embedded within each generated Epic file is a critical requirement for the **downstream `epic-story-generator` mode**.
*   **Deferral:** Lower-level implementation details (specific stories, technical approaches) mentioned by the user during plan confirmation should be acknowledged but explicitly deferred to the `epic-story-generator` phase.
