# Cursor Rules for Project Structure

# Project Vision
- Incremental game focusing on visual scale and automation
- Start with manual resource gathering, evolve into automated systems
- Progressive complexity: introduce mechanics gradually
- Visual feedback is crucial - players should see their progress
- Future plans for multiplayer/cooperative gameplay

# Development Philosophy
- Start simple, add complexity only when needed
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Keep components focused and single-purpose
- Extract reusable logic into hooks
- Maintain clear visual hierarchy in UI components
- Consider performance implications early (e.g., canvas vs. DOM)

# Code Complexity Guidelines
- If a component exceeds 200 lines, consider splitting it
- If a component has more than 3 levels of nested JSX, extract components
- If a hook manages multiple concerns, split it
- If you're passing more than 4-5 props, consider composition or context
- Avoid prop drilling more than 2 levels deep
- Keep functions focused: if a function needs more than 2-3 parameters, use an options object

# State Management
- Use local state for component-specific state
- Use context for shared state that spans multiple components
- Consider moving state up only when necessary
- Document state shape and mutations

# Performance Considerations
- Use React.memo() for expensive renders
- Keep canvas operations efficient
- Batch state updates when possible
- Consider using web workers for heavy computations
- Profile early and often

# Root-level directories
src/                            # Source code
  app/                          # Next.js app router pages
  components/                   # React components
    common/                     # Shared/reusable components
    game/                       # Game-specific components
      ${ComponentName}/         # Main component directory (PascalCase)
        index.tsx              # Main component file
        components/            # Child components specific to this component
          ${ChildComponent}/   # Child component that may have its own children
            index.tsx         # Child component main file
            components/       # Nested components (if needed)
              ${Name}.tsx    # Simple child components (if no further nesting needed)
        hooks/                # Custom hooks specific to this component
          use${Name}.ts      # Hook naming convention
        utils/                # Utility functions specific to this component
          ${name}.ts         # Utility file naming convention
        types/               # TypeScript types/interfaces specific to this component
          ${name}.types.ts   # Type definition file naming convention
        constants/           # Constants specific to this component
          ${name}.constants.ts

# File naming conventions
- Use PascalCase for component directories and files
- Use camelCase for utility files, hooks, and other non-component files
- Use kebab-case for CSS module files
- Always use .tsx extension for files containing JSX
- Use .ts extension for files containing only TypeScript
- Use index.tsx for main component files
- Prefix hooks with 'use'
- Suffix type files with '.types.ts'
- Suffix constant files with '.constants.ts'

# Component structure conventions
- Each major component should have its own directory
- Use index.tsx for the main component file
- Keep related files (hooks, utils, types) close to the component
- Nest child components in a components/ subdirectory
- If a child component becomes complex, promote it to its own directory

# Import conventions
- Use '@/' alias for imports from src directory
- Use relative imports for files within the same component directory
- Group imports in the following order:
  1. React and external libraries
  2. Components
  3. Hooks
  4. Utils/Helpers
  5. Types
  6. Constants
  7. Styles

# Type conventions
- Suffix component prop interfaces with 'Props'
- Suffix handler prop names with 'Handler'
- Use 'Handle' prefix for event handler functions

# Example structure:
src/
  components/
    game/
      GameWrapper/           # Main game component
        index.tsx           # Main component file
        components/
          GameCanvas/      # Complex child component
            index.tsx     
            components/   
          ManagementUI/    # Complex child component
            index.tsx
            components/
              ActionButton.tsx   # Simple child component
              StoneInventory.tsx # Simple child component
        hooks/
          useGameState.ts
        utils/
          animation.ts
        types/
          game.types.ts
        constants/
          game.constants.ts
